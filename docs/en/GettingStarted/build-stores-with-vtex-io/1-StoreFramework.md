# Store Framework

When comparing two or more online stores, we can notice similarities between their structure. For example: independently of the store we are browsing, it’s common to see highlighted products in the store’s window display, along with a search bar, menus, product pages with a buy button, logo, and so on. 

This shows us that there is a correspondence between online store components, no matter each store’s identity. This correspondence makes the store creation process easier, allowing a front-end development with a **single shareable component structure** among stores.

Within [VTEX IO](*link*), the [Store Framework](*link*) is responsible for laying the foundations of this structure for any platform store through our high quality, customizable [components](*link*) and open source code.

This means that Store Framework enables you to:

-   Have flexible, changeable, regularly tweaked components at your fingertips, all written in JSON and CSS.
-   Be natively integrated with VTEX APIs.
-   Send your store’s view events to analysis tools, such as Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. 

This track will show you how to build and customize a store in VTEX IO, using Store Framework and our ecommerce components.
