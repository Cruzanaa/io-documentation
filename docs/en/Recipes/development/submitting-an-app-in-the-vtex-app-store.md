#  Submitting an app in the VTEX app store

The [**VTEX App Store**](https://extensions.vtex.com/) is a marketplace for VTEX IO plug-and-play solutions. 

It can be used by any VTEX partners willing to **share their solutions** with other VTEX users so they can also **leverage their business**. 

As expected from something carrying the VTEX brand, the app store has a structured homologation process that makes developed apps available to the entire ecosystem.
 
The process comprises the following steps, along with required actions for each.

##  Step by step

Adding an app to the VTEX app store is based on four main steps:

1. Express your interest to our team;
2. Sign our commercial agreement;
3. Se cadastrar como vendedor na VTEX App Store.
4. Configurar os assets da app;
3. Send the app's data for validation;
4. App homologation.
