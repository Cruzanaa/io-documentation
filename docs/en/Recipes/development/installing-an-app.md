# Installing an app

Installing an app is a fundamental step for testing the reliability of your new code settings. 

Once your app is already [published](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/publishing-an-app), you are able to install it in any workspace you may be working on.

## Step by step

1. Using your terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/vtex-io-cli-installment-and-command-reference), make sure you are logged into the desired account and using the desired workspace;
2. Then, run one of the following commands according to your needs and scenario:

- `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}` or `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}@x` - To install the **latest stable version** of the app;
- `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}@{appVersion}` - To install a **specific version** of the app;
- `vtex install {appVendor}.{appName}@Ë†{appVersion}` - To install any available version from the `{appVersion}` onwards. 

When specifying the `{appVersion}`, bear in mind the permitted structures:

- `@8.0.10`
- `@8.0.10-beta.3`
- `@8.x`
- `@^8.0.10`
- `@^8.0.10-beta.1`

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Toolbelt only interprets installation commands with ranges by majors. This means minors and patches can only be specified in scenarios where one of the structures stated above is being used. App versions as `@8.0.x` or `@8.2` are no longer allowed.
