# Listing an account’s apps 

While developing in an account, we should be aware of all its installed or linked apps. With Toolbelt, access to the app list is made easy by running a single command.

## Command

`vtex list`

By running the above-mentioned command, Toolbelt will display a table containing the account’s apps and their respective version, as shown in the example below:

_Note that the table is divided into apps related to an **Edition**, apps independently **installed** and **linked** apps._
