# Installing the VTEX IO Toolbelt 

## Introduction

Any development in VTEX IO begins with the **Toolbelt**, our CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows you to login to the desired VTEX account, develop new apps and manage the already installed ones.

## Step by step

To install the VTEX IO’s CLI, you need to ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed on your machine. 

Thereafter, type `yarn global add vtex` in your computer’s terminal.

```
$ yarn global add vtex
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
To confirm that the installation occurred as expected, you can execute the <code>vtex</code> command. This should display all available commands in a help text.
