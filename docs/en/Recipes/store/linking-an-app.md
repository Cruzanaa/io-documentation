# Linking an app

When linking an app, your computer's local files sync to it. This means that any change you do to the code done locally will be sent to and reflected in the workspace in which you are working.

## Command

To link your app and start seeing changes in your code in real time, type the following command in the terminal:

`vtex link`

After that, IO performs a series of tasks on its own until the following message is displayed in the terminal, once everything is OK: `App linked successfully` 

From then on, every change can be seen in your browser in real time.
