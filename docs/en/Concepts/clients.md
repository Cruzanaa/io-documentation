# Clients on VTEX IO Services

Clients, on VTEX IO, are **abstractions to other services**. We tackle complexities when setting up an HTTP client, for example, so you can focus on the real value of your software. 

> *Leave the burden with us!*

**These are some of the features built in our clients infrastructure:**

 - Cache *(you can use disk on in-memory cache easily)*
 - Native metrics support
 - Retry and timeout options
 - Billing tracking *(you can easily charge who uses your app)*
